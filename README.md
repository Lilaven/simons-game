# simons-game

The Simon game is a memory game where players repeat an increasing sequence of lights and sounds. The game begins with a single color, and each round adds another color to the sequence, which the player must then reproduce by pressing the corresponding buttons. If the player fails to reproduce the sequence correctly, the game ends.
